            <h2>Overview</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="block_content">
            This pastebin was built using <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a>.  The original code was
            built by several folks as a tutorial for learning Wicket named <a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/blog/2009/03/09/5-days-of-wicket/" target="_blank">5 Days of Wicket</a>.  There's a link in the
            navigation to the <a href="http://github.com/kinabalu/mysticpaste/">source code</a> which you can peruse at your leisure.
            <br />
            <br />
            The idea of a pastebin is simple, copy all or a fragment of code you need help with into the content box on the page.
            Select which language the code is in for nice syntax highlighting provided by the <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/" target="_blank">SyntaxHighlighter</a>
            JavaScript library.  You will receive a small URL to paste into an email, IRC, mailing list, or instant message to receive help
            on your issue.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have plugins for 4 different development environments so you can paste directly from the editor.

                Added functionality is available for those who need more.
                <ol>
                    <li>To get the raw text of a paste, click the link or just append "text" to your URL i.e. /view/1/text</li>
                    <li>To download the paste, append "download" to your URL i.e. /view/1/download</li>
                    <li>To copy and paste the contents of a paste, just double-click the content area.</li>
                </ol>

                <br />
                To highlight certain lines in a text, append the line numbers separated by commas (will also accept ranges) like so:
                <ul>
                    <li>/view/1/1-3</li>
                    <li>/view/1/1,2,3</li>
                    <li>/view/1/1-2,3</li>
                </ul>

        </div>
